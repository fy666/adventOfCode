-day5 (seed to soil conversion -> intervals)
-day6 (time/distance optimization)
-day7 (sorting poker game hands)
-day8 (left/right graph)
-day9 (sequence extrapolation)
-day10 (loop path in a map, find enclosed area)
-day11 (expanding map with empty lines/columns)
-day12 (find combinations of groups of # in a string)
-day13 (find symmetry of a matrix, find "almost" symmetry -> difference of one)
-day14 (rocks moving on map with obstacles, in each directions)
-day15 (lens box, compute focusing power)
-day16 (light beams)
-day17 (shortest path with engine steering constraints (max 3 consecutive steps in same direction, part2 at least 4 before turning))
-day18 (contour area computing for segments)
-day19 (xmas intervals chain)
-day20 (signals)
-day21 (reachable tiles, repetition patter)
-day22 (cubes pile)
